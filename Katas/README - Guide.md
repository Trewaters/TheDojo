# `<STYLE>-Guide.md`
- the intent of the guide is to help sifus learn. There are multiple ways to solve any programming challenge. The guide shows one way to solve the kata in detail.
  - The guide is the place to outline all the details for accomplishing a kata "position".
  - List steps in bullets so they are easy to follow.
  - use back ticks to highlight code like so `code to do something`
  - or you can use multiple backticks to highlight sections of code like so
  ```javascript
  /// do some code here
  ```
  - Top of the guide has general `<STYLE>` commands and patterns.
