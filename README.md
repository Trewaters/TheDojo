# <THE_DOJO> 
Welcome to the <THE_DOJO> GitHub repo. We provide the structure of this repo in the Table of Contents. Each section listed in the table of contents has instructions on what and how to contribute to that section. These sections are also folders in the repo.

## `<THE_DOJO> Philosophy`
<THE_DOJO> is the first of hopefully many coding dojos. The primary principle of this coding dojo is work. Everyone must work for the knowledge and skills they wish to attain. The second principle is sharing. Once a Sifu (practitioner) has learned something they must be willing to share it with other Sifus that ask.

The goal of the <THE_DOJO> is to show Sifus how they can improve their skill set with continuous work on their craft.

# Table of Contents
- [Welcome, Get Started](README.md#get-started)
- [Katas](README.md#katas)
- [Koans](README.md#koans)
- [Meetings](README.md#meetings)
- [Projects](README.md#projects)
- [Wuxia](README.md#wuxia)
- [Yatate](README.md#yatate)

## Get Started
- Create a Yatate file and submit it with a Pull Request (PR) 
  - [Github Kata Position #1 here](./Katas/GitHub/GitHub-Katas.md#position-1-join-the-dojo-initialize-yatate-file)
  - [Github code guide for Position #1 here](./Katas/GitHub/GitHub-Guide.md#position-1-join-the-dojo-initialize-yatate-file)
- Attend a local <THE_DOJO> meetup.
  1. People who attend the meetup, in-person, are given a slack invite. Slack is used for all the sifus to stay in touch between our monthly meetups. 
  2. NOTE: Treat the slack like a public forum. 
- WORK... Work on your belts. Get a white belt from the Dojo.

## Katas
Patterns that help you deepen your programming knowledge. Katas are broken into a few categories designated by a sub-folder. Each kata folder has a `...-Guide.md`, `...-Katas.md`, and a `...-Fundamentals.md` file in it.

**Folder Contents**
- `README - Katas.md` - The coding katas. No code just a description of what is expected from the sifu.
- `README - Guide.md` - The guide file will pair with the kata's file exactly and give hints and code on how to solve the kata. There can be multiple answers for the same kata. Only one is listed in the guide. If you would like to add yours to the guide make a pull request for it.
- `README - Fundamentals.md` - The fundamentals file has some notes about how the language works. These are document level based bits of information. I use this as a cheat sheet for the language, reminding me about things quickly so I can keep coding.
- `README - Belts.md` - 

## Koans
Programming riddles to ponder. Expand your perspective and hopefully become enlightened.

**Folder Contents**
- `README - Koans.md` - 

## Meetings
Sifu notes taken during the meeting. Make your notes helpful to others reading them in the future. Think of this like Open Source documentation. It is a great practice.

**Folder Contents**
- `README - Meetings.md` - 

## Projects
Folder of code projects that <THE_DOJO> has worked on. Projects in this section have a "project lead". These project were merged into the list by the "Sifu **'Root'**".

**Folder Contents**
- `README - Projects.md` - How to add to projects list.
- `openSourceList.md` - List of open source software projects the community supports.
- `Sifu_Projects.md` - List of sifu led projects for anyone to contribute to. 

## Wuxia
<THE_DOJO> Wuxia are things you will need to do in any language. Wuxia is split into Front End Task, Server Side Task, Database Task, Web apps, and Mobile App Task.

**Folder Contents**
- `README - Wuxia.md` - What are wuxias for <THE_DOJO>.

## Yatate
[Step 1 for getting started](#get-started) is to create a Yatate file.

The Yatate is a folder of <THE_DOJO> members to create txt or md document named after their call-sign. 

The call-sign is your sifu name, the name you want to go by in the dojo. This is just for fun. It can't be the same as someone else's and should be respectful of others. The Yatate file is full of contact information for you. Read the "README - Yatate.md"

**Folder Contents**
- `README - Yatate.md` - Guidelines for addnig your sifu name and call sign to the repo.
